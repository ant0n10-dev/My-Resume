    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Antonio Mejia, a dedicated and goal-oriented professional with a unique journey shaped 
            by resilience, adaptability, and a passion for growth. My career began in the National Guard, 
            where I rose to the rank of Sergeant, leading and mentoring teams while taking on diverse roles 
            in combat medicine, emergency care, and recruiting.<br><br>
    
            These experiences have honed my problem-solving skills, leadership abilities, and adaptability 
            to high-pressure environments. Now, I am actively transitioning into the IT and software development field, 
            excited to work on innovative solutions that challenge creativity and logic.<br><br>
    
            Currently, I am completing "The Complete 2024 Web Developer Bootcamp," gaining hands-on experience 
            in HTML, CSS, and other web development tools. My background equips me with a unique blend of technical 
            aptitude, leadership, and a disciplined approach to problem-solving, making me well-suited for tackling 
            complex challenges in software development.<br><br>
    
            I am bilingual in Spanish and English, allowing me to connect with diverse teams and audiences. 
            My experience as a recruiter has further strengthened my communication and interpersonal skills, 
            which are crucial for collaborating in dynamic environments.<br><br>
    
            My goal is to grow into a full-stack developer and contribute meaningfully to a company that values 
            dedication, flexibility, and innovation. I am eager to bring the same level of commitment and resilience 
            that defined my military career to the IT industry, embracing opportunities to learn, grow, and create 
            impactful solutions.
